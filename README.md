# DXFutils

This repository will hopefilly evolve into a set of utilities for
working with DXF files.

My initial motivation was to extract SVG sketches from a 3D model.

THe repository currenctly contains a partial implementation of a DXF
parser.

The DXF Specification, such as it is, can be found
[here](http://images.autodesk.com/adsk/files/autocad_2012_pdf_dxf-reference_enu.pdf).
